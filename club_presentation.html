       <h2>about us</h2>
       <img src="image7.jpeg" alt="" width="810px" height="610px">
       <p>The ENSA Social Club was founded in 2017 by a small group of students who wanted to make a positive impact in their community.<br>
       What started with simple acts of kindness has grown into a movement involving food and clothing drives, blood donation campaigns, and humanitarian caravans for communities in need.<br>
       Our mission is to foster compassion, solidarity, and social responsibility among students, empowering them to make meaningful contributions to society.<br>
       We envision a world where young people take the lead in building inclusive, supportive communities, driven by empathy, respect, and unity.<br>
       Together, we strive to create lasting change for a better future.</p>
